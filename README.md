This setup provides a comprehensive structure for a modern enterprise-grade application using UV for Python package management, FastAPI for the backend, and React with TypeScript for the frontend. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

Backend:

Uses FastAPI with UV for dependency management
Includes a basic health check endpoint
Structured with separate directories for API, core logic, database, and models
Uses SQLAlchemy for database interactions
Includes a Dockerfile for containerization

Frontend:

React with TypeScript
Webpack for bundling
ESLint for linting
Jest for unit testing
Includes a Dockerfile for containerization

E2E Testing:

Uses Playwright for end-to-end testing
Configuration file sets up the test environment

Docker:

Docker Compose file to orchestrate the backend, frontend, and database services

CI/CD:

GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration
Runs backend tests, frontend tests, and e2e tests

Code Quality:

Flake8 for Python linting
ESLint for TypeScript/JavaScript linting

Best Practices and Conventions:

Use of modern tools: UV, FastAPI, React with TypeScript
Containerization for consistent environments
Separation of concerns in the backend structure
Type safety with TypeScript in the frontend
Comprehensive testing strategy (unit, integration, e2e)
CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
Linting and code formatting tools for maintaining code quality
Use of environment variables for configuration
CORS middleware for security in the backend
Module federation can be implemented in the frontend webpack config (not shown in this example due to complexity)

To fully implement this setup, you would need to:

Flesh out the API endpoints in the backend
Implement the React components and state management in the frontend
Write comprehensive tests for both backend and frontend
Set up proper logging and monitoring
Implement authentication and authorization
Configure proper production settings for each service

To run this updated setup:

Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.
Create a .env file in the project root with the necessary environment variables.
Build and start the services:
Copydocker-compose up --build

The backend API will be available at http://localhost:8000, and the frontend at http://localhost:3000.

For local development:

Install UV:
Copycurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

Set up the backend environment:
Copycd backend
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip compile requirements.in -o requirements.txt
uv pip sync requirements.txt

Run the development server:
Copyuv run dev

For linting:
Copyuv run lint

## This setup provides a solid foundation for a production-grade todo app within a larger enterprise application structure. It leverages UV for efficient dependency management, uses FastAPI for a robust backend, and is ready for integration with a React frontend.

To use these files and start managing your database migrations:

Initialize the migration environment (if not already done):
Copyalembic init alembic

Create a new migration:
Copyalembic revision --autogenerate -m "Create todo table"

Apply the migration:
Copyalembic upgrade head

To revert a migration:
Copyalembic downgrade -1

Remember to create new migrations whenever you make changes to your database models. This allows you to track changes to your database schema over time and makes it easier to manage deployments and database updates in a production environment.

docker-compose down
docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q)
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q)

---

Run the backend locally:
adjust the environment variables in the .env.local file

cd backend

uv run alembic init alembic
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Create todo table"
uv run alembic upgrade head

---

./run_local.sh

---

Add new migrations:
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Create todo table"
uv run alembic upgrade head
